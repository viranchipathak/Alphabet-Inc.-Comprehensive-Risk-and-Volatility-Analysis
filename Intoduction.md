# Alphabet-Inc.-Comprehensive-Risk-and-Volatility-Analysis
Fundamental, financial, and market-risk evaluation of Alphabet Inc., combining ratio analysis, volatility modelling (GARCH), and Value-at-Risk metrics to assess downside exposure and long-term investment risk.

This project provides a structured risk assessment of Alphabet Inc. from three complementary perspectives: fundamental business risk, financial stability, and share-price volatility. The fundamental analysis highlights Alphabet’s reliance on digital advertising revenues, exposure to global regulatory pressures, geographic expansion risks, and reputational or cybersecurity threats that may influence long-term performance.

From a financial standpoint, ratio analysis indicates strong liquidity, improving operating efficiency, low leverage, and exceptionally high interest-coverage capacity—collectively suggesting minimal financial distress risk and strong resilience for long-term investors.

Market-risk evaluation applies statistical measures of volatility, descriptive return characteristics, GARCH (1,1) modelling, and Value-at-Risk/Conditional VaR estimation. Results show moderate short-term volatility, non-normal return distribution with downside tail risk, and persistent volatility following shocks, implying meaningful downside exposure during stress periods.

Overall, the analysis integrates corporate fundamentals with quantitative risk modelling to provide a comprehensive view of Alphabet’s investment risk profile and portfolio-management implications.
